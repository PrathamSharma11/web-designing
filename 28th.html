He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2018.[9][10] Also that year, he was ranked 25th on the Forbes list of The World's Most Powerful People,[11] and was ranked joint-first on the Forbes list of the Most Innovative Leaders of 2019.[12] As of December 19, 2020, Musk’s net worth was estimated by Forbes to US$153.5 billion,[1][13] making him the second-richest person in the world, behind Jeff Bezos.[14]
    Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada when he was 17 to attend Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two years later, where he received dual bachelor's degrees in economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to begin a Ph.D. in applied physics and material sciences at Stanford University, but dropped out after two days to pursue a business career. He co-founded Zip2, a web software company, which was acquired by Compaq for $307 million in 1999. Musk then founded X.com, an online bank. It merged with Confinity in 2000, which had launched PayPal the previous year and was subsequently bought by eBay for $1.5 billion in October 2002. </p>
